===================================
LIBBLURAY INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
===================================

1. Build the source code (dependancies - full OpenSSL):

	make

2. Install the library (as root):

	make install
	
3. You're ready to go

Note:
This is a library. Which means that it doesn't do anything on its own!
You need (obviously):
	A player with support for libbluray
	Compatible bluray drive
	Relevant keyfile for the disc that you want to play
